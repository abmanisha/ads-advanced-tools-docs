    "# Onboarding and getting started with AMC APIs using Python \n",
    "\n",
    "The Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC) API Python collection is a set of pre-configured Python code that enables you to easily onboard Amazon Ads and start exploring AMC APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This collection contains the libraries, functions, and code required to get you onboarded Amazon Ads. Which means, some sections of this collection need to be executed only once to help you with your initial access and onboarding process, while the others must be executed before the start of every session.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this collection, ensure you have installed:\n",
    "- Python (version >=3.8) with urllib3<2.0.0,>=1.25.8\n",
    "- AWS CLI with botocore (required if you are using AWS Secrets Manager)\n",
    "\n",
    "To onboard the Amazon Ads API, you must complete the following prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create a Login with Amazon application**: Requests to the Amazon Ads API are made by a client application administered by Login with Amazon.\n",
    "- **Apply for permission to access Amazon Ads API**: The application form includes questions about how your business intends to use the Amazon Ads API, as well as information about the Amazon Ads API License Agreement, the Data Protection Policy, and Amazon Marketing Cloud Terms. If you are a partner, visit the Amazon Ads Partner page for information on how to apply for access to the API.\n",
    "- **Assign API access to your Login with Amazon application**. This step must be completed after your application is granted permission to access Amazon Ads API along with the scopes your application can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now execute each code block to begin your onboarding journey. \n",
